# TCOB 
TCOB is a declarative modeling language based on the concept of temporal constrained objects. Constrained objects [1] were proposed as a modeling framework for complex systems that consist of an assembly of interconnected, interdependent components. This paradigm uses object-oriented concepts such as classes, inheritance, and aggregation for structural modeling and declarative constraints for behavioral modeling. Temporal constrained objects  add a temporal dimension to constrained objects and facilitates the declarative specification of time-dependent behavior in complex systems. The key new feature is that of a series variable, which records the temporal sequence of values bound to a variable. Temporal constraints may be placed over the consecutive values of a series variable. TCOB allows temporal constraints through the introduction of metric temporal operators, which are metric variants of the classic F and G operators of linear temporal logic (LTL). The execution model for temporal constrained objects involves a time-based simulation along with constraint solving at each time-step. This document describes the syntax of TCOB programs and also the steps for compilation for visualization of program execution.
